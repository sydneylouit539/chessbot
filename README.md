# chessbot

This project will attempt to create a chess-playing bot utilizing the Chess
library in Python, and several bots calibrated at certain levels. 

## Goal
The ultimate objective of this project is to be able to create a chess-playing 
AI from scratch in Python that can play at any Elo level between 0 and 3000, 
allowing an extremely flexible range of skill levels for users to play with.

Some neural network approaches have been attempted, but have not yet yielded
a good fit. However, the data used to train is only a few thousand games.
Many of the world's strongest chess engines use neural networks, so this 
approach may be necessary for this bot to be able to reach the stated goal 
of playing at a 3000 Elo.

## Current Progress
This bot is still in the extremely early stages of development, and the Elo
level of the best bot in this project is currently about *1400*


## Estimated Elo History
 - 7/12/2024:   30 
 - 7/13/2024:  644
 - 7/14/2024: 1100
 - 7/23/2024: 1400
