This project will attempt to create a chess-playing bot utilizing the Chess
library in Python, and several bots calibrated at certain levels. 

## Goal
The ultimate objective of this project is to be able to create a chess-playing 
AI from scratch in Python that can play at any Elo level between 0 and 3000, 
allowing an extremely flexible range of skill levels for users to play with.

This bot is still in the extremely early stages of development, and the Elo
level of the best bot in this project is current about *100*
